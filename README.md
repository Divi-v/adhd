EEG ADHD Detection App -
This project is a web-based application developed using Streamlit for detecting ADHD using EEG signals. The application combines EEG signal processing techniques, classical machine learning (Random Forest), and deep learning (a hybrid CNN-LSTM model) for binary classification of ADHD vs. non-ADHD EEG data.
