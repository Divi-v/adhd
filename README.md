EEG ADHD Detection App
This project is a web-based application developed using Streamlit for detecting ADHD using EEG signals. The application combines EEG signal processing techniques, classical machine learning (Random Forest), and deep learning (a hybrid CNN-LSTM model) for binary classification of ADHD vs. non-ADHD EEG data.

Features
Upload EEG dataset in CSV or Excel format.

Visualize raw and filtered EEG signals using MNE.

Apply bandpass filtering (4â€“40 Hz).

Remove ocular and muscular artifacts using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

Compute and compare Power Spectral Density (PSD) before and after filtering.

Train a Random Forest classifier to analyze feature importance.

Build and train a deep learning model combining CNN and LSTM layers.

Display model performance: accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Predict ADHD status on newly uploaded EEG samples.
